## JS + React Testing (Bootcamp Activity) Instructions:

1. Clone this repo to your machine and open the folder in your preferred editor

2. Branch off from `main` and create a new branch following `firstname-lastname`

3. Inside `/components/helpers`, there's a `multiplyNumbers` helper function that takes in two numbers and multiplies them. Add a test for this function inside `/components/helpers/__tests__`

4. Inside `/components`, there are components for `Card` and `CardContainer`.
- For the `Card` component, add a test to make sure that it renders with the correct `header`, `description`, and `link`
- For the `CardContainer` component, add a test to make sure that it renders the correct number of cards
- Place the test files for these under `/components/__tests__`

5. Run `yarn test` or `yarn test [filename]` to run your tests

6. Once you're ready to submit your work, push your changes (no need to make a PR, I'll be checking out the branches)
